        <p class="imgDescText">This is a picture from my greatest achievement. During my time in the cadets, I went to many shooting
            competitions. There is an award that a Cadet can recieve called the <em>crossrifle badge</em>. You can get
            this award by obtaining an average score over the competition of 85%+. I did two competitions that day, one
            in the morning and one in the afternoon. In the morning, my average came out to 84.95% (which obviously was
            very disappointing). However, I managed to shoot much better in the afternoon and got an average of 89.17%,
            which got me my crossrifle award.</p>

        <p class="imgDescText">Note: Pardon the image quality, I have since left the Facebook group where it was posted and this is the only copy I have left.</p>
